        <p class="new-description">We've known each other for quite some time, and each time our strings tie, we become different versions of ourselves. I really love the most recent version of you, Jennyâ€”where you're no longer afraid to face your fear of being a burden to someone special. Weâ€™ll continue to grow together, make our dreams come true, achieve our goals side by side, and always be there for each other through everything. I'm your kakampi sa lahat ng bagay kahit mukha akong kalaban ðŸ˜†</p>
